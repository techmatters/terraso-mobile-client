msgid "soil##match_info##gelic_andosols##management"
msgstr "Preservation of the surface soil with its organic matter is important, and erosion prevention is critical. Land management practices should maximize soil cover. Because these soils are formed from volcanic materials a part of their soil charge is positive, which means they can ‘fix’ phosphorus, making it unavailable to plants in the cropping season. Well documented practices such as band application (either directly on the seed or to the side and down from the seed) of phosphate fertilizers will help to reduce P fixation. Additional fertilization and lime application, in addition to P, will also be needed to ensure adequate crop growth and yield. Cover crops and rotations that include legumes and inclusion of crops with high biomass would be beneficial, adding organic matter and nitrogen for the subsequent crop. Agroforestry systems can help minimize erosion. If used for production care should be taken to maintain organic matter, for when the permafrost is opened soil subsidence will occur. "

msgstr "Fibric Histosols are organic soils that typically form in wet environments. Their properties are largely dependent on the type and degree of decomposition of the organic soil materials. The soils can be productive with intensive management including soil drainage but their fragile nature and habitat suggests preservation of these soils is warranted where possible. When cultivated, subsidence and sulfide oxidation present management challenges. Fibric Histosols have relatively undecomposed organic soil materials. Thus, they have a slightly lower bulk density and higher water content. "

msgstr "These soils can be some of our most productive soils, especially for specialty crops such as vegetables. However, they must be drained for use, and this will lead to subsidence of the soil, as exposed peat is rapidly mineralized, and organic matter content quickly drops.

msgstr "These are productive soils, and can be used for crop production. They have excellent internal drainage and good water holding capacity. These soils do have a high degree of phosphorus sorption, and will fix phosphorus, making it unavailable for plant uptake during the cropping season. Phosphorus fertilization will be needed for best productivity. Well documented practices such as band application (either directly on the seed or to the side and down from the seed) of phosphate fertilizers will help to reduce P fixation."
