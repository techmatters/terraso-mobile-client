/**
 * A specialized SafeScrollView with extra bottom padding for screens that have a FAB
 * (Floating Action Button) positioned at the bottom.
 *
 * This variant uses SAFE_AREA_BOTTOM_PADDING_WITH_FAB (100px) to ensure content can
 * scroll clear of the FAB button, which is absolutely positioned and overlays content.
 *
 * Use this instead of SafeScrollView when your screen has a FAB button.
 * For screens with button rows (not FABs), use SafeScrollViewWithButtons instead.
 * For screens without bottom action buttons, use the base SafeScrollView.
 *
 * @example
 * <SafeScrollViewWithFab>
 *   <Text>Scrollable content</Text>
 * </SafeScrollViewWithFab>
 * <Fab label="Save" onPress={handleSave} />
