/**
 * A specialized SafeScrollView with extra bottom padding for screens that have a row
 * of action buttons at the bottom (e.g., Delete/Done, Cancel/Save button pairs).
 *
 * This variant uses SAFE_AREA_BOTTOM_PADDING_WITH_BUTTONS (80px) to ensure content can
 * scroll clear of large button rows, accounting for button height + spacing + clearance.
 *
 * Use this instead of SafeScrollView when your screen has button rows at the bottom.
 * For screens with FAB buttons, use SafeScrollViewWithFab instead.
 * For screens without bottom action buttons, use the base SafeScrollView.
 *
 * @example
 * <SafeScrollViewWithButtons>
 *   <Text>Form content</Text>
 * </SafeScrollViewWithButtons>
 * <Row>
 *   <DeleteButton />
 *   <ContainedButton label="Done" />
 * </Row>
