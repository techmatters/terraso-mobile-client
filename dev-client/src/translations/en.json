More frequent application of lower rates of soluble N sources may also be a management option.

However, they are at risk for soil loss through both wind and water erosion. Thus, practices to maintain soil cover (mulches, conservation tillage, windbreaks) are needed. Drainage of these soils may be needed. However, since this is saturation via groundwater this may not be possible, and thus shallow-rooted crops must be considered. If fertilized and not drained, loss of applied nitrogen (N) by denitrification or leaching is possible. More efficient crop N use in these soils can be achieved by:  1) drainage, and, 2) use of slow-release N fertilizers (if available). "
